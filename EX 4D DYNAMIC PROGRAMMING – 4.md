## DATE:

## AIM:
To find the minimum number of operations to convert str1 to str2 using Naive recursive method.

## Algorithm

1. If either string is empty, return the length of the other (base case).
2. If last characters of both strings match, set `cost = 0`, else `cost = 1`.
3. Recursively compute three operations: insert, delete, and substitute.
4. Take the minimum of the three operations plus `cost` where applicable.
5. Return the final result as the edit distance between the two strings.

## Program:

    if t == "":

    if s[-1] == t[-1]:
        cost = 0
    else:
        cost = 1
    res = min([LD(s[:-1], t)+1, LD(s, t[:-1])+1, LD(s[:-1], t[:-1]) + cost])
    return res

str2=input()

## Result:
Thus the program was executed successfully for finding edit distance between two strings.
